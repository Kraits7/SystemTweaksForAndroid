These tweaks should help revive an old/weak phone and give it some performance and smoothness without losing battery life and heating
These tweaks make some changes to system.prop that do:
Enable ZRAM (which allows apps to stay in memory longer) (ZRAM will be in version 2.0)
Enable Blur (this is no longer about performance, but about beauty)

IMPORTANT: Requires Magisk: 20.4 and above Also Android 9 and above
